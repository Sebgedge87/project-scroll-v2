# 🧙‍♂️ Project Scroll – Bootstrap GPT Message

I'm continuing work on Project Scroll — a Firebase + React TTRPG app. I've completed Week One and most of Week Two.

Please load context from this structure:

✅ Features complete:

- Auth and game creation
- Auto-created Session 1
- Games filter by GM or joined member
- Session viewing via `/games/:gameId/sessions/:sessionId`

📁 Folder Structure:

- `src/pages/`, `src/components/`, `src/app/games/[gameId]/`
- `src/stashed/` contains unscoped files (Login, Inventory, Notes, Signup)

❌ Scope rules:

- Do NOT add new features unless explicitly requested
- Do NOT restructure or abstract without permission
- Stick to roadmap in `README.md`

🧭 I'm now continuing:

- Rendering session detail view
- Displaying member list in GamePage
