# âœ… Week 1 â€“ Project Scroll V2: Foundation & Scaffolding

> ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:** Set up a clean, scalable base for a multi-user TTRPG app using Firebase, React, and Tailwind.  
> Focus on routing, Firestore structure, MVP game/session creation, and placeholder auth.

- [x] Add clean base routes:
  - `/dashboard` â†’ Game list and creation
  - `/games/:gameId` â†’ Single game page
- [x] Redirect `/` to `/dashboard`

## ðŸ”¥ Firebase Integration

- [x] Create Firebase project
- [x] Enable **Firestore**
- [x] Enable **Email/Password Auth**
- [x] Install Firebase SDK
- [x] Connect Firebase config to app
- [x] Create `firebase/config.js`
- [x] Test Firestore read with `getDocs()`
- [x] Enable **test rules** for development access

## ðŸŽ® Game Creation Flow

- [x] Create form to enter:
  - Game Title
  - System (e.g. 5e)
  - Session Day
  - Session Time
- [x] On submit:
